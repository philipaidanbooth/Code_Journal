This introduction outlines the framework behind each journal entry and the approach I plan to use for presenting them. Initially, let&#39;s delve into the journals&#39; purpose. Keeping a coding journal is a well-recognized practice in computer science. Reflecting on my first CS class in high school, we maintained a daily code journal to foster personal growth and skill development. My goal with these journals is to extend the concept of a CS journal. See at my core, I&#39;m a Classics major, which means the humanities deeply influence my perspective. Therefore, journaling will also be a way to chronicle my experiences and weave a narrative. I aim to selectively share journal entries each day, offering a glimpse into my journey in a manner that&#39;s accessible and engaging for anyone interested. My interdisciplinary approach has always enriched my understanding, serving as the driving force behind these entries.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Regarding the structure of each journal entry, my intention is to compose daily. However, I must acknowledge the potential for missed days. I&#39;ve set a guideline for myself: not to skip more than two consecutive days. I imagine each entry to be approximately a page in length, double-spaced, covering topics such as daily training, academic reflections, and interpersonal relationships&mdash;though names will be kept confidential. All this is preliminary, I hope to flesh out a better structure after writing more of these entries, but yeah, that is pretty much all the pre-reading knowledge you&rsquo;ve got to know before diving in. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 97 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">It&rsquo;s a cold, sunny morning in Northhampton. I recently arrived in Boston after my mini-abroad trip to Greece. My Jan-plan this year at Colby was on the Bronze Age Collapse, which meant two weeks on campus and two weeks traveling around Greece. It was an incredible experience, and I&rsquo;m glad to have been a part of the small fifteen-student fleet. After landing in Boston, I realized I had another week until my semester started, so I called up a friend and asked to crash at his place. It worked out pretty well because two other Colby friends of mine were also planning on crashing this guy&rsquo;s place later in the week. In Boston, I mostly hung out with my friend Ethan from high school in the few days I spent there. We grew up playing soccer, and if you don&rsquo;t know much about me, Soccer is a cornerstone of my life. All to say, that shared passion has cemented him as a core person in my life, so I was eager to spend as much time with him as possible. Later in that week, after my other two Colby friends arrived, I asked one of them if I could crash at his place in Northhampton. I figured it would be a good idea to spend my last few days with Matthew before starting classes since he&rsquo;s my marathon training partner and, on top of that, one of my closest friends. So here I am writing in Northhampton. It&rsquo;s a nice quaint town, and Matthew&rsquo;s house is across from the pretty Smith College. In the few days I have been here, we have gone on a handful of hikes, runs, and dog walks. Today Matthew and I plan on doing our long run of the week. At this point in the training, it&rsquo;s about ten and a half miles. In addition to running, I am also trying to read. I say trying because I am the sort of person to have my mind flutter off after reading a paragraph or two. I&rsquo;m currently reading Haruki Murakami&rsquo;s memoir </span><span class="c3">What I Talk About When I Think About Running.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s fun to hear about other peoples&rsquo; thoughts from their runs, especially a writer like Murakami. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s ten o&rsquo;clock now, and in an hour, I have a Zoom call with Matthias H&uuml;ls. He is a data scientist who tracked his marathon using, you would never guess it, data. I&rsquo;m also interested in doing the same thing but on a smaller scale. See, my marathon is in four-ish months, and he collected data over the span of one year. I already prepped some questions and am excited to see what he has to say about my plan. My reflection about today&#39;s upcoming meeting will likely be tomorrow&rsquo;s journal prompt, but I also hope to develop another sort of descriptive entry on what I want the format of my journal entries to be.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 96 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Today, I &nbsp;arrived back at Colby College. On my last morning in Northhampton, I walked my friend&#39;s dog Hazel around 8:00 am. I remember a chill wrap around my hands as I squeezed Hazel&#39;s leash, but it was sunny and pretty outside, which was enough motivation to continue the walk. On the walk back, Hazel was carrying a branch the length of my arm. She was proud and tapping her feet the whole way home. When I got back to my friend&#39;s place, no one was there, which was surprising since it was only 8:30 am. I didn&rsquo;t mind, though. I sat on the couch and continued to read Murakami&rsquo;s &nbsp;</span><span class="c3">What I Talk About When I Think About Running.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Those first few sentences of the paragraph were my attempt at internalizing some of his language. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Today, I also outlined the structure and framework behind these journal entries. The main idea is to present a single website entry and rotate them daily. This method of showcasing the entries is a recent idea, and a question I have been asking myself since this decision is as follows: How will knowing each of my entries could be the potential spotlight then impact the way I write each entry? What sort of things will I keep out of each entry, and what characteristics might I amplify to appeal to potential employers or people who do not know me? These are elements I would like to be conscious of when writing these entries, and the immediate connection I can draw to people with a similar dilemma are soccer players. These are athletes competing with some of the greatest live audiences in all of sports. How do all those eyes impact not only the way they play but the way they present themselves as people? Surely, there has to be some performative aspect to these guys? Of course, on the pitch, they showcase their character (which I intend to do with pen and paper), but they also likely censor parts of themselves to appeal to their audience. These are just thoughts as I continue to flesh out my style of writing these journals. Tomorrow is my first day of second-semester classes. I&rsquo;m looking forward to them!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 95 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I start my second-semester classes today. It&rsquo;s 10:05 am, and I just came back from my statistics class. We read through the United States v. Kristen Gilbert case, a case through which there were statistics regarding the nurse Kristen Gilbert putting her in a place of suspicion. I don&rsquo;t want to get too sidetracked, though. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I have three classes today: Stats, Comp Sci, and Environmental Studies with R. This semester, I decided to load up the data science classes to help me decide whether I&rsquo;d like to major in the field. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m also hoping I can get some assistance from my professors in these classes with the Marathon project I&rsquo;m currently working on. On the topic of Data Science, I have recently been stressed out about getting an internship this summer. I mentioned on the first day that after I wrote that entry, I would meet with the Brooklyn-based Data Scientist Matthias Huls. The meeting went well. I figured that since we had a lot in common (German soccer players transitioning towards long-distance running), that he would have some useful input on the journey. He did, but I at the same time, I felt a bit insecure about my education up until that point. Matthias got a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering and then transferred to the field of data science. Meanwhile, I&rsquo;m taking classes about whether the Trojan War happened or not. I find myself to be naturally fine at math, but I can only imagine the skills some of these people have at the higher levels of Data Science.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Further in my exploration to find people who had experienced a trajectory similar to mine, I found Kyle Johnson, a classics Ph.D. graduate from NYU who transferred to the data science field. I read an article he wrote, </span><span class="c3">An Affable Guide to Leaving the Classics</span><span class="c0">. While I&rsquo;m not someone who wants to leave the classics right now, I would like to have a trajectory out once I feel like I have developed enough in the sphere. Otherwise, I would be funneled down the path of academia, which I know is something I do not want to pursue. Reading Kyle&rsquo;s article reinstilled my confidence in myself that I could transfer to such a seemingly opposite field, and I&rsquo;ve written up an email I plan on sending to him once I get his contact information.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 94 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While jogging on the treadmill today, I pondered the topics worthy of today&rsquo;s journal entry. It struck me that I was allowing my thoughts to be influenced by my perceived audience, who were my prospective employers during this introspective moment. Note my current thought process too. I&rsquo;m aiming to showcase a single journal entry each day on the front of my marathon website so people can get a picture of who I am on a day-to-day basis. However, my intuition to let my employers/audience mold my thoughts goes against the purpose of my journal in the first place. I want to showcase an authentic account of my life leading up to my first marathon. So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll try my best to do. But at the same time, I did figure out what to reflect on in my journal today. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s currently 9:15 pm. I had both a statistics class and a Greek class. I can already see how my stats class is going to help me create my marathon graphs. I have some time, though, since Matthias said to start tinkering with the data once I have a substantial amount of it. I filled in the rest of my day with Java tutorials and internship applications. Kyle Johnson got back to me, and I told him about my project. Tomorrow, I have a meeting with my career center to talk about applications. Although there&rsquo;s a lot on my plate right now, I feel like I&rsquo;m balancing it okay. I&rsquo;m excited to see how the next few weeks go when classwork picks up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 93 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Indoor track sprints today. The last time I did these, I couldn&rsquo;t talk for ten minutes after. I had a packed day of classes before, which is odd for a Friday, I know, but that&rsquo;s sort of how my schedule panned out. I rushed out of my career center and darted for the track field at 4:30 pm. I managed to make it there right in the time my other training partners had arrived. We warmed up for two miles and then got to the fun stuff. We did 2x800m and 2x400m. Looking back, this is probably nothing to write home about, but if you&rsquo;ve ever done any variation of 800m, well then you know they suck. After the quick fifteen-minute session, though I felt great &mdash;much better than I had felt the previous time around. Noticing this improvement added to that great feeling and I&rsquo;ve been riding off of it since. It&rsquo;s currently 7:30 pm and I figuring out what to do tonight. The Greece trip that I went on for the bulk of january has it&rsquo;s reunion tomorrow on Saturday, and Sunday is the Superbowl, so I&rsquo;d like to take it easy tonight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Switching pace quite heavily here, I learned a great deal about R &amp; R Studio today. Both my Stats and exploratory data analysis using R gave the same tutorial today. I&rsquo;m glad they did so I could really ingrain these foundational tools in my head. All my classes are going great, but my Greek professor is challenging me to take the more advanced course. It&rsquo;s a lot more work, but I think I&rsquo;m cut out for it. We&rsquo;ll see, but I don&rsquo;t have much time since the registrar stops the add/drop for courses on Monday. Reflecting on today&#39;s journal entry, I like how I can dedicate part of it to running and the other part to my data science journey. All to say, I&rsquo;m having fun with it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 91 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was bound to happen. Yesterday, I didn&rsquo;t complete a journal entry. It never crossed my mind until this morning when I had been planning today&#39;s journal entry. This is alright, though&mdash;more to share in today&rsquo;s write-up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Today&rsquo;s Sunday, it&rsquo;s 5:50 pm and the Superbowl is about to start, but last night I had a reunion with everyone from my January Greece trip. All of us carpooled over our professor&#39;s house in Belstaff, Maine. It was about a twenty-minute drive, but thirty if you account for the Domino&rsquo;s pizzas we had to pick along the way. Seeing everyone back at school was a new experience, I thought the dynamic would be similar to when in Greece, but for some reason, I was a bit more stiff over there. I think that just like in highschool, being in an academic environment is so stressful that even something as laid back as pizza and a movie night with a professor and classmates scared me a little deep down. Oh yeah, the movie we watched together was the director&#39;s cut of Troy with Brad Pitt. Retracing that stress I was feeling, though, I&rsquo;m going to attribute that to some classic high school Riverdale PTSD. It was an odd feeling that I&rsquo;ve been trying to rid for a while. I&rsquo;ve been learning about the scarcity versus abundance mindset and have been planting myself on the track from one to the other. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Moving on from the reunion, I headed over to my Greece roommate Tanner&rsquo;s dorm. We kicked it for a little, and I followed him to a house party across campus to meet some of his friends. Tanner&rsquo;s a freshman so I&rsquo;ve got no clue what I&rsquo;m walking in to. His friends seemed cool and I spoke with a few of them. I left after fifteen minutes but it was nice getting to see a little part of Colby I&rsquo;ve never seen before. After, went back to my room and threw on my audiobook. I&rsquo;m listening to Steppenwolf by Herman Hesse right now. It&rsquo;s a little dark and heavy. Those two tend to go hand in hand, but I&rsquo;m completely drawn in by the audiobook and play it whenever I get a moment to disconnect and put my headphones on. I went out later with some friends and yada yada you get the picture.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 90 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I ran 34 miles last week. It&rsquo;s the most I&rsquo;ve run in a week by a long shot, and it&rsquo;s not including the 11.5-mile run I did yesterday too. I forgot to mention that in the previous entry. Today is my rest day, thankfully. I just finished a solid two-hour Greek translation session. I&rsquo;ve been practicing with both Greek and Latin to get into these flow states for roughly two hours each time, although I heard that our attention spans are typically only about 1:30 hr. They are my sessions with the muse. I need to feel completely consumed by the work in order to do it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">During my time in Greece this January, I was lucky enough to talk with two masters at seemingly disparate crafts: Eric Cline, a renowned Bronze Age author, and Vassilio, a traditional Cretan potter. I noticed that in their explanations for how they went about their craft, they mentioned their affiliation to a muse. Perhaps this is because both are affiliated with ancient Greek history in some way or another, but I felt there was some connection. Eric Cline said he&rsquo;d be eating breakfast, but if he felt the presence of the Muse, he would scurry to his desk and begin writing. For Vasilio, when constructing and painting ceramic replicas for museums, he said he needed to feel the inspiration of the muse throughout every brushstroke or else he&rsquo;d stop and take a break until he was again inspired. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I found the connection between these two interesting and have been trying to piece together how the muse may influence my workflow. I noticed today in my study session that I had a dip in focus the fifteen to twenty minutes before I began work. Then once the time was right, I focused easily without looking at the clock and two hours flew by just like that with all my lines translated and papers neatly stacked. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s all for today. There wasn&rsquo;t too much life exposition simply because I had classes the whole day. I&rsquo;m starting to get a better idea of how I want these entries to go, but I need a little more time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 89 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Today, I did hill sprints. While most of my marathon training has been feasible up until this point, these hill sprints presented quite a challenge. My partner and I planned on six twenty five-second sprints, which seemed simple enough on paper. My partner hadn&rsquo;t done them yet and he suggested 30 seconds. After our first set we both agreed to drop the sprint to twenty seconds. Even with a compromised duration, my partner made it four sets, and I made it five. We dedicated our walk back to the gym for breathing. There was no air to spare for chatting. Before and after the sprints, I completed two respective two-mile runs. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m beginning to get antsy about receiving my Garmin data. I sent an access request a few days ago, but no response yet. I&rsquo;m excited to start messing around with the data and see the further steps I need to take. Matthias, the data scientist and runner, sent me some steps to take my raw api data into charts. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Transitioning to the CS component of my journal entries, today I completed most my week 1 project in Java. I&rsquo;ve been doing coding boot camp to get up to speed with java, and have been solidifying my understanding of object-oriented programs, which seems to be the cornerstone of Java as a language. Yeah, it&rsquo;s currently 10 pm, and I think I&rsquo;m going to head to bed soon. Looking forward to getting my hands on that Garmin data.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 88 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fast-paced day today. No classes until 11:00 am, so I spent the morning working on my LinkedIn and conducted typical busywork. My classes went from 11:00 am-1:00 pm. From there, I grabbed packages, got lunch with some friends, and met with a professor. Around 2:00 pm, I relaxed and called my Dad and then my grandparents. They sent over some Valentine&#39;s Day gifts. From 3:00-5:00 pm, I worked on a Greek translation of Euripides&rsquo; Medea. I was able to get into flow state for almost the entirety of the session. After Greek, I ran at Colby&rsquo;s AC. Today, I just had time for an easy run. Right as I finished the run, I sprinted over to grab dinner because I learned that some friends were watching the Bob Marley movie that recently came out. So yeah, I did watch One Love on a Wednesday at the Waterville flagship cinema and I&rsquo;m happy I did. It was a fun, spontaneous idea, and I&rsquo;m hoping it gives me enough fuel to power through to the end of the week!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 87 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">My Garmin export finally got processed. I&rsquo;m excited to begin the process of creating this project. I&rsquo;m sure the scope of everything will change with time, but as of right now, I plan to showcase charts in tandem with my development up until the marathon date. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Today I decided to run outside despite it being thirty degrees out. There&rsquo;s a 4.5-mile loop I&rsquo;m acquainted with, so I figured that if I ran relatively quickly, I&rsquo;d be able to stay warm. I stopped by the cross-country locker to grab an undershirt from a friend on the team and got going. I&rsquo;ll admit I fumbled the pacing of this first mile. I ran a 6:12, which is pretty much all out for me. By the time miles 3 and 4 came around, I was experiencing some harsh cramps in my abdomen. On the bright side, that sort of pain tolerance will be necessary to endure when running the marathon, but the moral of the story is to pace yourself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The last thing I&rsquo;m trying to experience right now is burnout. Who knows how many times I&rsquo;ve started and stopped something because I was motivated one day and burned out the next. Part of the reason I took up a challenge as big as the marathon was because I feel like, at this present moment, I have enough tools to maintain habits and prevent burnout. Famous last words, though. We&rsquo;ll see! No one seeing these entries unless I&rsquo;ve gotten to that very last day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 86 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s a Friday, I just got back from the gym, and it&rsquo;s about 4:30 pm. I have yet to plan what I will do this evening, but my friends want to get together. Friday mornings are not typically eventful since everyone is burnt out and ready for the weekend. For the case at Colby, a lot of kids go out on Thursday nights too, so there are a few kids running on fumes today too. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In my CS class today, I learned about adding items to arrays in Java and, specifically the protocol for when an array&rsquo;s size/count equals its capacity. I&rsquo;m getting a lot of motivation to stay engaged in my classes because of the applicability of what I&rsquo;m learning to this current passion project. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tonight, I could potentially begin tinkering with my running dataset. It&rsquo;s quite small as of right now due to the fact that I haven&rsquo;t logged runs for an extensive period yet, but it will be useful in growing accustomed to the data type and how to manipulate it. Also, whatever questions I come up with, I can ask professors in the data science department at Colby about it. One professor happens to be teaching my intro stats class. Anyway, that&rsquo;s it for today!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 85 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Two weeks! Today marks the 14th day of my journaling journey&mdash;13 days, to be precise, if we account for the day I missed. Nevertheless, it&#39;s a significant milestone for this part of my project. Journaling with an audience in mind has been its own unique mental adjustment. I discussed largely in entry 2 my anticipated outcome of writing a typically private form of writing for a public audience. How will my writing be influenced (for better or for worse)? I think some added pressure on creating presentable writing is great, but looking back on my past few journal entries, their quality and depth are beginning to fade. I am quite proud of my first 7 entries, but yesterday&rsquo;s entry was bland. I walked through how my day went like a typical journal entry, but now I&rsquo;m self-conscious that I only have mundane activities to write about. On the one hand, I am realizing this journal is pushing me to continue pursuing exciting and relevant experiences. On the other hand, I have to realize that not every day is going to be a ten out of ten day. I think I need to develop more of a formula for how I go about these entries. Perhaps not a rote method cranking out similar style entries, but maybe have an idea of how to write a reflective entry versus an expositional entry. Today is very much so a reflective entry, but yesterday, as I mentioned, was purely expositional. I need to figure out how I can provide this sort of nuance to my website showcasing so that my audience recognizes that not every day is going to look like the selected journal entry they are reading. Those are all my thoughts for today, we&rsquo;ll see what sort of entry I will write tomorrow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 84 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sunday mornings in my book should be reserved for coffee and quiet, but this Sunday morning called for something else. I woke up in a panic that I&rsquo;d be late and quickly ran upstairs in my dorm hall to shake my friend Matt. We were ski-instructing kids, and I was a bit nervous since I had never ski-instructed kids before. I&rsquo;m also a bit of an amateur in comparison to the two other guys I planned on going with. Matt had grown up ski racing and probably would have gotten recruited had it not been for a serious ligament tear in his knee. My other friend had been instructing at the mountain for a while and was the one who invited me to come in the first place. It&rsquo;s not like I can&rsquo;t ski, I&rsquo;ve been skiing since I was a little kid, but the instructing aspect of the job made me nervous. The first things that pop into my head when coaching are, &ldquo;am I gonna teach him the wrong technique?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What if I embarrass myself in front of this kid and his parents?&rdquo;. For me, those thoughts instantly disappeared when I started my private lesson with a kid. I&rsquo;m a quiet guy generally, but give me any sort of one-on-one interaction, and I&rsquo;ll have a blast. I&rsquo;ve been a tutor in my Latin for a while, so those intuitions kicked in, too. I think I get nervous because teaching is such an important thing for me, and I really appreciate the sort of teaching I have received throughout the years. Looking forward to my next week coaching the little ones! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 83 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Monday is my busiest day of the week. I attribute this to my six hours of classes throughout the day: Statistics, Data Analysis with R, CS, and CS lab. I usually have energy to get through the classes but then the rest of the day is when the real challenge starts. Today especially challenged me because I have two workouts and a Zoom meeting on top of homework. None of these activities are a drag to me, in fact I looked forward to the majority of those tasks, but still where does one get the energy for these things. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On top of being aware of time management this year, I am also equally dialed in on energy management. One can only enter flow state so many times a day. For me I&rsquo;m looking at two 1:30hr sessions usually. The rest of my work I do at a steadier pace. For me, I am writing this journal entry with some residual minutes of focus after completing my Greek homework. I can almost always fall into a strong flow state when working with my ancient languages since I&rsquo;ve built a routine around them. Computer science flow states are different, and I find that I can&rsquo;t consistently fall into them like with Greek or Latin. It&rsquo;s nothing I&rsquo;m worried about, but when I crack the code for getting into CS flow state, then I bet I&rsquo;ll make a bigger jump with my time management. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As I said I&rsquo;m writing this entry after having finished my Greek homework. Before that I was on a call with the CFO of my Mother&rsquo;s company, since I was trying to learn about Data Seience. The past couple of weeks I&rsquo;ve been sprinkling in meetings with data scientists and while, he is not exactly a data scientist, he did get his masters in it. The meeting was productive and he helped to develop a better picture of the job field as well as give me steps for positions to apply to. My day is still busy after all this. I have soccer practice from 8-10 pm and still need to get some dinner! It&rsquo;s 6:45pm right now. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 82 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Between my last journal entry and today&rsquo;s entry, I played soccer twice. Right now I&rsquo;m incredibly sore, it&rsquo;s 10:45 pm for reference. The reason I bring this up is that I need to figure out how to integrate soccer practice into my running schedule. I feel like right now I&rsquo;m a bit out of balanced with my training, since I&rsquo;ve already played soccer twice this week. It&rsquo;s not like I want to restrict my happiness by playing less soccer, but if I want to continue on my goal of running this marathon, I need to make some sacrifices. In that respect, my goal this week will be to figure out how to schedule in Soccer in balance with running. Also, Matt my training partner, doesn&rsquo;t like to play soccer, so it throws our training plan out of whack the more I play soccer. I knew playing less would be a factor in deciding to run this marathon, so now I just need to continue executing the plan. I&rsquo;m currently unwinding tonight with an episode of top gear with some friends. Glad to call today another success. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 81 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yesterday I wrote an exposition-style entry that covered my day&#39;s trajectory. I fear that today may be the same, but I&rsquo;ll try and wiggle my way out of it. We&rsquo;ll see. My day is defined by the fact that it&rsquo;s a rest day. The two days in a row of soccer on Monday and Tuesday have taken it out of me. However, that did leave lots of time for me to get ahead on work. It&rsquo;s currently 8:30 pm, and I&rsquo;ve completed all my work for the day. I&rsquo;m hoping to have an early night tonight, which my roommate has also agreed upon. Trust me, if I had any energy left in me, I&rsquo;d be playing soccer in 15-degree weather right now but I just can&rsquo;t. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This weekend, after going into a funk for most of Sunday (and a bit of Monday), I found myself doing a random character analysis of Hamlet. Hamlet is a person meant for the theatre, not for politics, like his father likes him to be. Now I&rsquo;m not saying that I&rsquo;m also trapped under the will of my father. I think if one would get to know me, that&rsquo;s very much not the case even though I love my Dad and he rocks. Tracing back, if Hamlet were born with traits like Claudius, there wouldn&rsquo;t be much of a story because after Hamlet&rsquo;s ghost father presents him with the deed to kill his usurper, Claudius would get it done. As I transition to a field that I&rsquo;m not so accustomed to and one that people don&rsquo;t think I belong in, I start to feel some of Hamlet&rsquo;s ambivalence regarding whether or not to carry out the murder or not. To those people who don&rsquo;t think I should be going down this sort of road, well, even though Hamlet may not have been cut out to be a king, he still put on quite the performance in his strives to be one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 80 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I feel a bit bad for my audience if today is the day you are reading my entry. I know it puts a dampener on the rest of this short read, but to be honest, today was mostly a logistical day. I called my Mom, my Dad, and my Sister individually. We are all separated right now. My parents aren&rsquo;t together (but still both in New York City), and my sister is at university in Canada. Everyone is doing alright, I think.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I also had a meeting with Colby&rsquo;s career center once again about my internships. Thinking about what sort of job I&rsquo;d fit into has led me into some deep introspective moments. I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of soul-searching. A lot of staring at walls and sprawling out on my carpet, but all of it I think is a necessary part of my process. Of course, the best sort of progress comes when that thought is paired with action. I am aware that I tend to air more on the side of analyzing as opposed to doing so, but the fact that I&rsquo;m aware means I can take action more consciously. Along the lines of what I said in my previous entry, I&rsquo;m more of a Hamlet than a Fortinbras. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 78 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yesterday marks the second day that I skipped a journal entry. I&rsquo;m trying to pinpoint why exactly I missed it but I can&#39;t exactly say why, which is a bit concerning considering I&rsquo;ve got at least ten more Fridays before I&rsquo;m finished with this part of my marathon journey. Maybe I&rsquo;ll figure out other ways to write about things. On my long run today I listened to DataFramed, a podcast meant to introduce people to the rising field of data analytics. It&rsquo;s interesting to hear that most of the previous generation of Data scientists came from other fields and after a point almost self-diagnosed themselves as data scientists. No one was actively going to school to become a data scientist. These people just happened to have all the tools necessary to be one, and were at the right place at the right time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The only problem with this initial perception of mine is that the podcast host has a Doctorate in Biology, so most of his guests, especially in the first few episodes, are from a similar tract as him.

I&rsquo;m currently writing at 9:20 pm after taking a break from my CS project due tonight. The project itself was not terrible, however, there were reflection questions in which I had to learn how to make a dynamic buffer queue. The TA I was just trying to figure it out with had trouble explaining it to me, but if I could tell you in my own words what it is it would be this: A list whose front and end are located at the same index, so that adding and removing items can be done at O(1) whereas a regular list does these tasks at O(n). </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m not in a great mood because I thought I&rsquo;d be able to submit this project by 10:00 pm tonight, but after 2 hours of little to no progress, I don&rsquo;t think I will be able to do it. This is one of the most frustrating feelings. I&rsquo;m also beginning to get nervous because I&rsquo;ve got a presentation coming up this Thursday and a soccer game next Saturday, so I won&rsquo;t have much time to finish my project. I&rsquo;m praying that I don&rsquo;t get into another situation like this. This week is probably going to be the equivalent of my finals week last semester, and I don&rsquo;t even have any tests coming up. Sorry for complaining, it&rsquo;s one of those days.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 76 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">I had another CS day. Today&rsquo;s entry may require further context from my yesterday&#39;s one. Here&rsquo;s what you have to know. I had a deadline last night to finish a project and a circular array file. The key word is </span><span class="c3">and. </span><span class="c0">I had no clue that I needed to finish the additional file too. I&rsquo;ve been chatting with other CS majors, and they all told me that circular arrays are one of the toughest assignments in this class, the class which happens to be the hardest class in the department too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I had a nonstop workday until 6:00 pm. It was satisfying at the end and I finished submitting my work. I also got to talk with a CS professor who also happened to be a classics undergrad. I&rsquo;m going to note that as an inspiring moment in my journey here. I know there&rsquo;s not too much talk about running right now, but I&rsquo;m learning the focus of these entries will be constantly shifting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For the end of today&rsquo;s entry, I&rsquo;m going to give a shot at explaining a circular list. Okay. When adding an element to an ArrayList in java, you put it at the index size of that list. But say you have an arraylist that has values in it and you&rsquo;d like to insert an element into the beginning of that list. You would have to copy every element into a new array whose indices are shifted over one. This will require a for loop and will wound up with a big O notation of O(n). In layman&#39;s terms, it&#39;s not efficient. A circular arraylist aims to shrink the runtime of a method like addfirst from O(n) &rarr; O(1). Rather than intuitively holding the first index at the beginning of the list, the first index is recalculated every time an element is inserted into the front. It is calculated by decrementing the first index by one and then modulo (%) by the capacity. Modulo gives the remainder, so the distance from the previous first index can always be found, and since the method doesn&rsquo;t use a for loop, the run time is O(1). </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 75 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Last Tuesday, I journaled about my need to integrate soccer into my running program. Well, today is the one-week update on this plan. Here is what I have adjusted. Last week, I played soccer on Monday and Tuesday, leaving the rest of the day for me to be sore and force a second rest day in the week. As a result, my mileage was considerably lower. Rather than the two previous weeks of 35 and 38 miles, I ran 28. I know it&rsquo;s not the end of the world, but my priority is the marathon. That is what I want. When I&rsquo;m on the treadmill, I&rsquo;m not thinking, &ldquo;Oh I wish I could be playing soccer right now&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m finding that I enjoy sticking to a plan, which brings me to my next topic in this entry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">This past week, I&rsquo;ve begun to listen to the podcast </span><span class="c3">DataFramed</span><span class="c0">. It&rsquo;s an educational data science podcast that suits my understanding perfectly. I recently finished the podcast episode on how to use data science techniques to benefit your day-to-day life. I&rsquo;d love to incorporate some practices into my everyday life, except I don&rsquo;t feel as though I have the right recording methods to be able to consistently track data. For example, I have tried to record how much homework I do a week, and I ended up stopping because my recording methods were not consistent. I&rsquo;d be using a timer sometimes and then guessing whenever I forgot. What about work that you do slowly over the course of a few hours? What I learned from the podcast is that I need to frame a question and then move from that point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 74 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I think this officially marks over a quarter of my journey toward running the Sugarloaf marathon. My workout today consisted of 2 miles around the track proceeded by my club soccer practice. The practice went short though, and I only played about fifteen minutes. I&rsquo;d say I ran the equivalent of three miles today, which is perfect for my training plan. I didn&rsquo;t want to play a full two hours of soccer today or else I would be ready to workout tomorrow. Instead, now I can exercise tomorrow, rest on Friday, and play soccer on Saturday. I&rsquo;ll see if I&rsquo;m up for a long run this weekend, but I think soccer may have to count for it instead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Today was not a heavy CS day. I spent most of my afternoon on a presentation for my Greek Tragedy class. We are reading Euripides. I think it&rsquo;s a great play, but we&rsquo;re mostly just reading Greek and not spending as much time on the play&#39;s plot. I wish this week could be a bit more interesting for my audience. Let&rsquo;s see if I come up with any fun activities this weekend!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 73 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I had a presentation today in my Greek class. It was fifteen minutes and with questions ended up taking thirty. I arrived late to class since the printers took extra long to get working. I knew this though and still decided to take my time. Once I got to the classroom, everyone was already circled up including my professor who had taken my spot in the room. The only spot left was the Professor&#39;s desk and empty chair, which he gestured for me to take a seat in. It was silent for the long minute that I spent handing out papers and setting up my notes, and then I started. I thought the presentation was strong, but I lacked succinctness in delivering my points. Presenting is a skill I&rsquo;m seriously working on, so any sort of mistakes I made I have exaggerated in my head. Right after class, I walked to the AC to run on the treadmill. After I clocked my four miles, I rushed back to my dorm to shower and get dinner with my roommate and his parents. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 72 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s currently 11:00 pm on a Friday. I&rsquo;m deciding to stay in tonight because I&rsquo;ve got a soccer game against Bowdoin tomorrow, and I figure a good night&#39;s sleep will help out the performance. Friday&rsquo;s are usually packed for me since I&rsquo;ve got four hours of classes and today was no different. Actually, today was worse because I had a bunch of deadlines I had to catch up to since I most my time I spent on work this week was dedicated to my presentation on Thursday. I&rsquo;m glad that portion of my week is over and that I&rsquo;m also starting my weekend off strong. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Reflecting back on the week, I&rsquo;m glad that I have been able to stay in touch with my family members despite having so much work.

I had my first soccer game of the spring season against Bowdoin yesterday. We, unfortunately, lost, but I still had a good experience overall. We arrived at 3:45 for the 4:30pm game, and right as we stepped out of the car, it began to rain. For the next two hours, it rained, and we played. The shower after the ride back was heavenly. I didn&rsquo;t get up to much that Saturday night. I hung out with some friends five minutes before they went to a house party and decided to sneak off to my room on the way there. I asked some of my friends today about it. They thought I was at the party with them that night, pretty funny. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I spent most of the day coding. No one wakes up before 10:30 on a Sunday at Colby, so if I sleep in the night before, I can typically get some work done. Today, perfectly aligned as I woke up at 9:00 am, did work until 10:30 am, and then watched the Manchester derby at 10:30 as my roommate was waking up. Later today I ran with my training partner. I couldn&rsquo;t do a long run, but we did a solid 6.0-6.5 miles. The most notable part of my day came when a high school friend told me that he was also majoring in Data Science. We caught up and he was telling me about the internship he was doing. He had apple music and spotify data from small musicians and he&rsquo;d calculate their expected growth and whether the artist should be signed to his company record label. It&rsquo;s a fitting job for him too since he&rsquo;s a music major too as well as &nbsp;a talented singer and producer. I&rsquo;m hoping that I can find my niche when it comes to a data science position like that. For me fitness is what music is for my friend. It is my energy source when I&rsquo;m working on a project, which is why I&rsquo;m having a great time along this marathon journey.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 69 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">My Tuesdays, I typically spend catching up with work in the morning, since my first class begins at 2:30 pm. I&rsquo;m sorry I just got hit with a wave of stress. I was granted an extra day to submit an assignment. I ended up completing it, but I forgot to submit it. I submitted it tonight and realized that I may not be able to get credit for it because the answers were already posted. I never looked at the answers and didn&rsquo;t know they were posted, but I don&rsquo;t think I can prove that. I&rsquo;m super embarrassed to be writing about this, but I think I&rsquo;ve got to be transparent and I can&rsquo;t really think of anything else to write at this time. This also happens to be the only time I can write today since I&rsquo;ll probably go to sleep after this. I can&rsquo;t skip today because I missed yesterday too. I did have a pretty good day overall, and I&rsquo;m sad that I&rsquo;ve got to end it on this low note. Today was actually a tough day now that I&rsquo;m thinking about it. I brought up with my Greek professor that I wanted to drop down a level in the class because I felt like I was going to fall behind. Unfortunately, the add/drop date has already passed, so I&rsquo;d need to sign a petition. I also had a therapist and had to talk about uncomfortable past experiences. Today wasn&rsquo;t a bad day, it was just tough.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 67 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m at a low point in my marathon journey right now. I&rsquo;ve been missing days of journaling, although not two days in a row yet. That wouldn&rsquo;t be good. I&rsquo;m going to mainly attribute it to my recent lack of sleep. It&rsquo;s not so much that my workload has gotten worse but that my stress levels have gone up so much that I&rsquo;ve found myself unable to get work done. This is the cause of my lack of sleep and other shortcomings, but it is by no means the end of the world. I&rsquo;m quite aware that I can be harsh towards myself, so I want to give myself a bit of a break. And what better time to do that than the day before my Stats exam tomorrow at 9:00 am? I&rsquo;m being sarcastic but in all seriousness, I do want to take it easy. I have found that all the interactions with professors and some other adults who I&rsquo;m not used to talking to have sapped my battery.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I hope that I can find out how to get back on my horse, but piledriving work doesn&rsquo;t seem like the best way to go about it. Trust me, I&rsquo;ve done it in the past, and it doesn&rsquo;t usually eliminate the root cause. I&rsquo;m hoping that positive social interactions can help, but honestly, I don&rsquo;t know what will. My social battery is toast, and I really don&rsquo;t want to watch any sort of short-form context because it is a glorified time-sucking blackhole. I think I&rsquo;ve landed on the healthy medium to do some work but finish early and with time to hang out with friends.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 65 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s a late Saturday afternoon, and I&rsquo;m not doing so hot. But, I want to keep up the daily logs. Last Friday night I played soccer and ran. Soccer is usually the highlight of my today, but the past few sessions, ever since the first game of the season, it&rsquo;s been less enjoyable. There have been a few key factors that have slowed my progress in everyday life, these may or may not be confounding elements but I will still try and list them out. I had my first ever therapy session last week, and it took a lot out of me socially. In addition, I presented in my Greek class that didn&rsquo;t go so well mainly because I didn&rsquo;t understand the article I had to present, which destroyed my _________.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 64 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This lazy Sunday I spent finishing up my third CS project of the semester. Before I got started though I had to watch some premier league: Liverpool vs. Man City. If you know these teams then you&rsquo;ll know this was a must-watch match. They are currently first and second place in the league.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m not sure if you will be able to see my previous entries leading up to today, but just know that they&rsquo;ve been rough. I fell into a funk this week. Don&rsquo;t worry, I think it&rsquo;s finally passing today, and I&rsquo;m incredibly happy about it. As you know, I spent most of today working on my CS project. It&rsquo;s called Agents, and its goal is to help me with linked lists. Well, anyway, I went to the TA hours today, and the person helping me was really inspiring and breathed some life into me. I ended up working for a good three hours on the project to get it all done and I felt energized walking back to my dorm from the CS building. This week I hope to get back on track and build structure into my days. I don&rsquo;t need to be perfect, but applying some focus can take you pretty far. I feel like I&rsquo;ve gained some focus today.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 63 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">My day started a bit late since my 9:00 am stats class got canceled. It&rsquo;s a big week for me with a CS exam on Wednesday and an exam in R on Friday. I&rsquo;m more scared for the R exam, but I&rsquo;ve got more time. It&rsquo;s 9:30 and I haven&rsquo;t done work for either of them today. I don&rsquo;t know if you can count it but I have spent three hours doing CS between my lab and my class today. My plan for the rest of the day is to hopefully go over some old R scripts and read R documentation. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I may need to put a dampener on my long runs since I have lost my running shoes. Usually, when I lose something, it randomly reappears. I know that probably a odd way to live my life, just waiting for a lost item to make its way back to me. It does have a surprisingly high efficacy, except for this instance. I&rsquo;ve spent my week retracing the steps, but I found nothing. Luckily they were quite old shoes, and I&#39;m in the store for new ones anyway. I&rsquo;m thinking I&#39;ll head over to dicks sporting goods in Augusta, which is about 20 minutes from Colby. Well, now that I&rsquo;ve lost my running shoes, I&rsquo;m alternating back to more soccer-dominant exercise, so I ran 4 miles and played soccer for 90 minutes too. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 62 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s 9:00 pm on a Tuesday. I ran about seven miles today with Matt, my running partner. I&rsquo;m beginning to feel noticeable improvement with regards to my how I feel when I run as well as reduced soreness after runs. I also just got some new running shoes which I&rsquo;m ecstatic about. They are the Saucony Triumph 21&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s given me a fresh wave a excitement that I feel toward running again. The freshness in my mentality and feelings of improvement are boosting my motivation to begin developing the data showcase. I think I still need to wait a bit longer though. Maybe I&rsquo;ll begin on around the 50-day mark. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I also need to come up with a project proposition for my stats class. The project proposal is due on Thursday and my partner and I haven&rsquo;t met yet. I want to come up with a supplementary study that could potentially be added to my website by the end of my marathon journey. That&rsquo;s about it for today. Tomorrow I&rsquo;ve got my CS midterm so wish me luck.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 61 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I don&rsquo;t know if this counts, but it&rsquo;s 12:00 am on Thursday technically, but we&rsquo;re counting this as my Wednesday. For a little more context as to why I&rsquo;m writing so late, I had a CS exam today. It went well, and my last big exam is Friday so I should probably get to bed soon. Anyway, after I finished the exam, I went to soccer practice from 9-11 pm. It was a fun practice, despite there only being ten people who showed up. I decided to play soccer after the midterm because I thought it would be best to conserve energy up until the exam. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After Soccer, I went through my nightly routine, and by then, it was already 11:30. I then just watched TikTok on my phone until 12:00 am, which doesn&rsquo;t happen every night, but oh well, I had an exam tonight. I think I need to balance being tough on myself with occasional moments of letting go a little bit. If you don&rsquo;t release at all then I&rsquo;ve found all the habits you&rsquo;ve built up come crashing down. It&rsquo;s like pacing yourself for a marathon. Sometimes you&#39;re moving too fast and you&rsquo;ve got to step off the gas for a mile or two. Maybe you even have to walk for some of it. As long as you know you&rsquo;re gonna finish the race. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 60 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Today&rsquo;s Thursday, but all I can think about is Friday. I mean, I have a test, but what&#39;s more important is Colby&rsquo;s annual doghead celebration. It&rsquo;s a tradition where students drink apple juice from sunset to sunrise, and of course, stay awake for all of it. The college is aware of the tradition and open dining hall hours for the majority of the night, which is nice. While yes I&rsquo;m excited for the night, I also know it&rsquo;s going to mess up my routine a little bit. I don&rsquo;t remember the last time I pulled an all-nighter, but it was probably early in high school.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hopefully, I&rsquo;ll be able to write an entry tomorrow.

It was doghead. For all the non-Colby people reading these entries, doghead is a tradition where students stay awake from sunset to sunrise. I figured that I&rsquo;d miss Friday because of this event. And for anyone on the edge of their seats to find out if I made it to sunrise, I did not stay awake to see it. In order for you guys to understand why I couldn&rsquo;t manage to stay awake, we have to go back to Friday morning. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Since two weeks ago, I&rsquo;ve been dreading Friday. Not because of Doghead but because of my R programming midterm. It&rsquo;s sneakily made it&rsquo;s way to being my most challenging class, and we&rsquo;ve never had any sort of assessment yet. I put off work to study for this exam as well, so right as I got out of the exam, I had to do homework until around 7:30 pm. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I peeled a banana as I walked towards the exam room at 1:00 pm for a little energy boost to get me started on the right foot. I had another one in my backpack in case I got hungry again at the halfway mark. It&rsquo;s safe to say the banana strategy worked because when I left that test room, I don&rsquo;t think I could have done any better. But the day wasn&rsquo;t finished, and like I expected, I&rsquo;d be doing homework for the next 3 and a half hours. You can imagine by the time I finished, I felt like a zombie, and pretty close to finishing I got invited to a party downtown that I felt I couldn&rsquo;t say no to. So right after I finished working, I showered threw some green clothes on, and took off for the shuttle downtown with my friends. We got back to campus at 11 or so and I had a great time downtown, but I was incredibly tired, so in an hour I passed out. Yeah that&rsquo;s my mundane story of how I didn&rsquo;t make it to sunrise on doghead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 56 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yesterday I pulled my hamstring. I had two club soccer games down by Umass Lowel on Sunday, and I pulled it towards the end of the first game. It was an unfortunate circumstance where only 13 people showed up to play two full-away games. Right after I realized I pulled my hamstring, I walked off the field and cried because I was sad I would have to stop training for the marathon. Luckily this will not mean I can&rsquo;t run the marathon in May, but I certainly cannot train for the next few weeks. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Getting injuries suck, but I have been thinking of injury protocols in the back of my head in case I was to get one during my marathon training period. These are the obstacles that make marathon training tough. After I get through this, you can believe I&rsquo;m going to be that much more motivated to run. I don&rsquo;t want to set anything in stone yet, but I hope to dial in an even stricter training protocol during my time injured because once I get back into training, time will be of the essence. I&rsquo;m doing research on everything I can do and want to get back in the game asap.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 55 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s the Tuesday before Spring break. I&rsquo;ve spent most of the day working because I don&rsquo;t have too much else to do. Most of my time is divided between studying for my Greek test and building a CS project. On Sunday with 56 left in my marathon journey, I pulled my hamstring. I don&rsquo;t know the exact recovery time, but it&rsquo;s likely gonna be around 3 weeks. It sucks, but I&rsquo;ve got to handle it in the best way possible and not give up. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So far I have tried to establish a protocol of sleeping a lot as well as eating healthy, which has been a success. I hope to continue this up until break and incorporate physical therapy as soon as I can. There&rsquo;s not much more to say on this front. I need to continue working in this system up until break and then reconvene there. For spring break, I&rsquo;m going to the DR with some friends. I&rsquo;m super excited and hope my hamstring doesn&rsquo;t get in the way too much.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 44 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Today&rsquo;s journal entry is coming once again from my room before I go to bed. It&rsquo;s different though because it&rsquo;s my first journal entry back since the break. 11 days total. I&rsquo;m excited to be back, and it doesn&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;ve betrayed myself by not journaling. I think I needed a break, and since a lot happened this past week, I should have some ammunition for the coming days. Of course, I can&rsquo;t get into all the details, but a large group of friends and I left for Punta Cana for five days. I had a great time, and I&rsquo;m ready to end the school year strong. I&rsquo;ve spent the last couple hours or so building a system for these last five weeks or so. I still have a little ways to go, but the main gist is balancing out the marathon with my schoolwork. For those who don&rsquo;t know either, I strained my hamstring a week before my break. Today marks exactly 2 weeks since the day of injury. It&rsquo;s stressful to stop training, which spurred me to build a system to be a little more precise with training and balancing workload. I know there&rsquo;s not too much context or contemplation today, nonetheless good to be back. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 44 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alright, today I am going to begin my long anticipated Dune review. Friday March 29, 2024 I watched Dune Part 2. Exactly two weeks before, I watched Dune Part 1. It&rsquo;s all quite fresh in my mind, not to mention I have been churning through the book as well, and at the present moment of writing, I am somewhere in the equivalent of the Dune&rsquo;s part 2 film. I personally did not see anything wrong with the first movie. I find that Frank Herbert&rsquo;s Worldbuilding is one of my favorites in sci-fi. Particularly, I like his decision to leave out computers because it shifts the spotlight purely on the prediction of human development and the evolution of the mind. The minimal architecture throughout the film also made for a pretty environment unlike other futuristic worlds. I am realizing that I could write about this for hours, so I&rsquo;m going to wrap up today&#39;s entry and hopefully link in a review of both these two films by the end of my project (Post-edit Philip here. I never made that review). For people who don&rsquo;t know me, I love films, and I took plenty of film classes in high school and college. However, theatre is the ultimate form of entertainment, but thats for another day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 42 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I woke up a minute before my alarm and waited, ready to rip off my covers. I set up my alarm on my wristband to vibrate so that I don&rsquo;t wake up my roommate. Maybe jumping out of bed and tying my shoelaces made it someway in his dream. Before I knew it I was running outside. Maine is a bit chilly in the morning in early spring but warms up by noon. I was running at a brisk pace, but only at the cadence my hamstring would allow me to go. I pulled it a little over two weeks ago. I tried running on it the day before, but I ran so slowly that I just opted to do my physical therapy routine instead. Waking up to run this morning was a gamble since I didn&rsquo;t know if my leg would be better or not but luckily with the help of that PT, solid recovery, and sound sleep I was able to get going at a respectable pace. I enjoyed the run and it set the tone for the rest of the day. I think I&rsquo;m going to continue doing these morning runs going forward now that the weather has cleared up. However, it is supposed to snow over a foot this weekend, so maybe I&rsquo;ll refrain from the outdoor run this weekend. Anyways the recovery for my leg is going well and I&rsquo;m excited to get back on track with my marathon training.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 42 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Just came back from the classics club movie night. I know it sounds like a grand production, but if you really want to know, it was just my co-president&#39;s friends and me. It was five of us in total, and since we didn&rsquo;t have the pressure of following through with the intended film (The Life of Brian), we watched 10 Things I Hate About You. You know, that sort of counts as a film in the realm of classics since it was based on Shakespeare&rsquo;s</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Taming of the Shrew</span><span class="c0">. Anyways, we ordered domino&rsquo;s just for us five, and watched the Rom Com. I wasn&rsquo;t originally intending on doing this today, but someone just reminded me of the importance of keeping fresh social interactions, and I hadn&rsquo;t done something like this in a while. I had a good time, too!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To update everyone on the training, my hamstring has almost made a full recovery. I decided to take a break from running today since there was an actual blizzard outside and instead worked on posterior chain movements, which should help out my hammy. Yeah that&rsquo;s it for today!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 42 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&#39;s 7:30 this Friday. I&#39;ve had quite a packed day considering that it&#39;s a Friday, but I&#39;m feeling pretty energized still. I had classes from 12 to 3, then work from 3:00 to 4:30, followed by a workout from 4:45 to 6:30. I&#39;m writing after my shower and a lackluster cafeteria dinner. I&#39;ve got compression sleeves around my legs, which feels funny, but I often write my daily entries with them on. It&#39;s a good way to stay productive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On the note of productivity, I want to reflect on my week of recording all my homework and aiming to reach a quota for each subject. The pros are that I was mostly able to reach daily quotas, which I calculated should be 2 hours and 40 minutes. I know this does not seem like too much work, but I&#39;ll tell you it&#39;s more than you&#39;d think. I was able to stay on top of work and, surprisingly, spent a lot of time recording the minutes and planning out time chunks. I did seem to lose steam on Thursday, so next week the plan will be to do less work on Wednesday so that I hopefully don&#39;t feel that Thursday burnout.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lastly, I wanted to update you on my injury. It&#39;s been almost three weeks since I pulled my hamstring, and it feels great. Today I was able to run five miles with relatively no hamstring soreness. The caveat, however, is that my heart rate was incredibly high the entire run. I&#39;m talking like 20 beats over what it should be. I need to figure that out. That&#39;s it for Friday, though!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Journal Entry - 40 days out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">My lazy Sunday began a little before 9:00 am with a big breakfast followed by 2 hours of debugging my Sudoku CS project. The result of those 2 hours: the program </span><span class="c3">sorta </span><span class="c0">works. Anyways, I kept my chin up, walked back at noon just in time to join all my friends&rsquo; first meals of the day. It&rsquo;s lazy Sunday after all, I don&rsquo;t blame them. Lunch was followed by watching some Premier league, and then finally by 2:00 pm I started getting in the running mindset. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Matt and I had a big run today. We were thinking of somewhere between 14 and 16 miles and ran just short of 16 (15.8). It was a bit nerveracking to go back into my first long run for about 3 weeks since I had no idea if I&rsquo;d be able to make it the whole way without having trained. In the end, I felt solid albeit incredibly tired after. Luckily, since it was my friend Quinn&rsquo;s birthday he got us Domino&rsquo;s and we all watched the Big Short, which caused temporary hysteria for all the econ bros in the room. I found it more entertaining to watch it supplemented with their reactions. I had a solid day today, and I&rsquo;m glad my run went well. I&rsquo;m currently in the library studying for a stats exam next this Friday. Good night!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
